## Overview

The CS Calculator 2.0 comes preloaded with reference sources.. These sources include CIE standard illuminants for luminaire and daylight sources, blackbody radiators, and other standard sources such as halogen, metal halide, low pressure sodium, and high pressure sodium.

## CIE

The International Commission on Illumination, better known as CIE (based on its French name), had published standard sources in the mid-1900s to represent average commercially available sources that produced white light as well as average daylight spectra. Tungsten-filament lighting (Illuminant A), natural daylight fluctuations (Illuminant series D), equal energy radiator (Illuminant E), and fluorescent lighting (Illuminant series F) are a few of the standards included in the CS Calculator for reference.


## Blackbody

Blackbody reference sources are also included. Because a blackbody radiator is a temperature radiator of uniform temperature whose radiant output in all parts of the spectrum is the maximum obtainable from any temperature radiator at the same temperature, these sources can be useful as a reference source for that average correlated color temperature (CCT).

## Custom Sources

If you plan to use an LED source especially, it should be noted that each LED product is unique and can have varying qualities which cause them to have vastly different color qualities, such as color rendering index (CRI) or circadian stimulus (CS), from one to another, even if it is classified as the same CCT. For this reason, it is important to upload the particular source(s) used in your product or lighting design. With the continual replacement of standard sources with LEDs, the pre-loaded sources become more obsolete, however, they are still useful to reference when getting familiar with the calculator.
